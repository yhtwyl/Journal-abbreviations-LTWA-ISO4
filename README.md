# Journal-abbreviations-LTWA-ISO4
This matlab program gives abbreviations for journal titles according to LTWA ISO4 rules. These abbreviations are implemented by some of the Taylor and Francis Journals.
To generate the abbreviations first import the csv file (also available on the website https://www.issn.org/services/online-services/access-to-the-ltwa/) into the matlab workspace and then run the matlab program for any journal title. The program will print the abbreviated journal titles on the command promp of the matlab. You can also convert into a function and run as a part of another main program. One implementations could be to make a list of all the journals titles as a text file, which can be fed into a program to output a list of abbreviated journals.
